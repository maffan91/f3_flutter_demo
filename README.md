## Running Web project

Assuming you have already installed Flutter for web, follow these steps:

- Checkout `web` branch
- Run the following command:
  - `webdev serve --auto restart`
    If the above command didn't work, try:
  - `flutter pub global run webdev serve --auto restart`
    This will run the application on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
